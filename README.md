CSCI 4100U - Mobile Devices - Fall 2015 - Final Project by Dylan Kauling and Alvin Lee

Basic Navigation Drawer style app with a Star Wars Theme in anticipation of The Force Awakens launch

Feature checklist (Course Relevance):
Navigation drawer (MVC, best practice to use fragments with nav drawer rather than multiple activities)
Countdown timer until movie launch (Additional functionality)
Google Maps API/Places API based theatre finder (GPS/Internet Resources)
Trailer viewer (Media Playback) - Not working
Trivia quiz (local storage/databases) - Not working
Settings menu for map configuration (local storage/app preferences/saving state)
Send Feedback (Intents)
Custom layout colour and font file (User Interface/Asset integration)
Strings/keys subject to change/internationalization are contained in strings.xml (Internationalization)
Functions/variables appropriately named, some proper indentation may be lacking (Best practices)
Only form input is validated to be an int (User interface)

Building may run into issues depending on your IDE configuration
Requires Google Play Services API for Maps integration
Last build of the APK was added to the repo in the /app/ directory to demonstrate app without building
Downloading to device and allowing installation from unknown sources should work
File authors listed at top of files with reasonable accuracy, commit logs also visible for comparison
